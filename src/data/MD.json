During the provisional ballot canvass (held on the second Wednesday after the election), the local board of canvassers will determine, based on the information submitted by the individual challenging the voter and the challenged voter, whether the voter is whom he or she claims to be and is otherwise qualified to vote.","subtopic":"How does a voter defend their eligibility to vote if they are challenged?"}]},"name":"Voter ID and Challenges","voter-id":{"name":"Voter ID","subtopics":[{"citations":["COMAR 33.07.06.03","http://www.elections.state.md.us/voting/election_day_questions.html"],"date-acquired":"2011-8-23","fact":"First-time voters who did not register in person with a government official and did not provide ID with their registration form","subtopic":"Who must show ID to vote?"},{"citations":["COMAR 33.01.01.01","http://www.elections.state.md.us/voting/election_day_questions.html"],"date-acquired":"2011-8-23","fact":"(1) Maryland driver's license, MVA-issued ID card, student, employee, or military ID card, U.S. passport, or any other state or federal government-issued ID card; or (2) a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document that shows the voter's name and address","subtopic":"What ID is acceptable?"},{"citations":["COMAR 33.07.06.05"],"date-acquired":"2010-6-11","fact":"No. If a person does not provide the identification information, they may cast a provisional ballot.
